# Milestone 3 
# Part 0: Preliminaries
- Project has main files stored in client and server folders, .gitignore is ignoring all of node_modules, application is only using expressjs and node.js, package.json has type=module specified

# Part 1: 
- The application is using the http server and expressjs library. All routes (get, put, delete, post) are being used in routes.js (starter file). At least one route is receiving and responding with JSON data.

# Part 2:
- Fetch calls are being made in script.js. Due to the rendering of different html views and the switch case for each page, it was best to keep everything in the same js file. User is providing data to fetch through the forms. Almost all api endpoints are sending and receiving JSON data. 

# Part 3:
- All CRUD operations are being used in the backend. The database in use is mongodb. User can create an account, read/find a person's data, update a user's detail or delete a user's account. 

# Part 4:
- Alerts and code logic were used to prevent a user who is not logged in from entering the /account route/page. Other routes like /login are inaccessible once the user is logged in. 

# Part 5:
-  As video and link (below) show, the application has successfully deployed on Heroku.
