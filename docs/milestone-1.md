# Team Overview
Tamara Sarita - github: ts355

# Application Idea
My application is a cultural exchange blog where the blogger will post about an interaction they had with a different culture (e.g. travel experience, attended a religious gathering, visited a local cultural festival/event, etc.) in order to inspire others to learn more about the diverse world around us and the people in it. The data used will mostly consist of images, text (title of post, blog's text body, etc), list of countries/cultures, hashtags, user comments, and likes. 

# Functionality
This blog will function similarly to personal blogs. The owner will be allowed to create/edit/delete blog posts with images, a text title, and description body. They will also list any culture/country the post mentions and have the option of adding individual hashtags. A visiting user will be able to add comments, likes, and search through blog posts via country/culture or date/time.
