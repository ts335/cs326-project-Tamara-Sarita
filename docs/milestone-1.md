# Team Overview
Tamara Sarita - github: ts355

# Application Idea
My application is a cultural exchange blog where the user (owner) will post about an interaction they had with a different culture (e.g. travel experience, dinner at a friend's house, visited a local cultural festival/event, etc.) in order to inspire others to learn more about the world around us and the people in it. The data used will mostly consist of images (within a blog post), text (title of post, blog's text body, etc), list of countries/cultures, hashtags, user comments, and likes. 

# Functionality
This blog will function similarly to personal blogs. The owner will be allowed to create/edit/delete blog posts with images, a text title, and description body. They will also list any culture/country the post mentions and add individual hashtags. A visiting user will be able to add comments, likes, and search through blog posts via country/culture or date/time.
