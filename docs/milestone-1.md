# Team Overview
Tamara Sarita - github: ts355

# Application Idea
My application is a cultural exchange blog where the user (owner) will post about an interaction they had with a different culture (e.g. travel experience, dinner at a friend's house, visited a local cultural festival/event, etc.) in order to inspire others to learn more about the world around us and the people in it. The data used will mostly consist of images (within a blog post), text (title of post, blog's text body, etc), list of countries/cultures, hashtags, user comments, and likes. 

# Functionality
"provides a brief paragraph or two explaining the functionality provided by your application, how it is used, and how it interacts with the data it maintains"
This blog will work similarly to other kinds of blogs.
